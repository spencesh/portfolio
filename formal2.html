			<h1>Introduction</h1>
			<p>Having all the information and knowledge in the world is no good, unless that information can be shared. This comes 
			down to communication. The ability to communicate is one of the most important skills to have, and it will always be 
			this way. Imagine a world where there was no way to interact with others. There was no reading, writing, talking, no 
			communication at all. It would be a world with no advancing, since no information or knowledge could ever be shared to 
			others. Everyone would be in a vegetable state, living in their own minds, no interaction with the world around them. 
			That is why having a variety of literacies are such a vital skill to have in language. Looking at a specific discipline: 
			the medical field, there is no surprise to the fact that the most important skill to have is effective communication. 
			
			Commonly, most students claim to either like math and sciences or reading and writing. One's that typically enjoy math 
			and science despise reading and writing, so they believe if they go into a field of study with a specialty in math or 
			science they can run away from all the things that they hated in high school english class. This will never happen in 
			reality. It is impossible to ever completely avoid these skills unless that person wanted to live in confinement. 
			Looking specifically at the medical field, reading, writing, and research are just as if not more important than 
			science itself. Technological and rhetorical literacies are used everyday in the medical field, it is what it truly 
			comes down to, to communicate knowledge in the field.
			
			Literacy work done in the medical field is very important since it can and does have a huge negative effect economically 
			and quality of life for some. Health Literacy is defined as "the degree to which individuals have the capacity to 
			obtain, process, and understand basic health information and services needed to make appropriate health 
			decisions"(National). Health literacy requires a complex group of reading, listening, analytical, and decision-making 
			skills, and the ability to apply these skills to health situations. For example: the ability to understand instructions 
			on prescription drug bottles, appointment slips, doctor's directions and consent forms. "Low health literacy is linked 
			to higher risk of death and more emergency room visits and hospitalizations, along with Low health literacy is a major 
			source of economic inefficiency in the U.S. healthcare system" (National).
			
			Important knowledge is no longer important if it cannot be shared. The medical field is all about encompassing the 
			variety of healthcare professionals to maintain and restore health by prevention and treatment of illnesses among 
			people. In order to have knowledge be shared, research needs to take place. With no correct answer for one single 
			illness, it is vital for research to always be taking place. More symptoms, more treatments, and more diagnostic 
			skills need to constantly be researched in order to advance the medical field. It doesn't just stop there, this 
			research needs to be shared to others performing research and to those who use the research. This communication step 
			is key. </p>
