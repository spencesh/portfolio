			<h1>Executive Summary</h1>
			<p>My formal research report is to inform new premedical students the expectations of literacy in the medical field. 
			This crucially involves the communication of knowledge from research and findings through reading. Communication is 
			equally important if not more important than actual science is in the medical field. Important knowledge is no longer 
			important if it cannot be shared. The medical field is all about encompassing the variety of healthcare professionals 
			to maintain and restore health by prevention and treatment of illnesses among people. In order to have knowledge be 
			shared, research needs to take place. With no correct answer for one single illness, it is vital for research to always
			be taking place. More symptoms more treatments and more diagnostic skills need to be researched to advance the medical 
			field. It doesn't just stop there, this research needs to be shared to others performing research and to those who use 
			the research. This communication step is key. Information in the medical field is commonly shared by journals, seminars, 
			and reports. Technology has an impact on this as well. The use of computers are needed in order to often access the 
			journals and the research of others. Technology has a major role in the medical field. Not only is its role in 
			communication, but also in advancing the field as a whole. It advances the way doctors prognose diseases and treat 
			them as well. 
			
			One source found explains the importance of medical research. In detail, it shows how professionals in the medical 
			field have to keep up to date in their research, and this is done through different programs, medical journals, and 
			interaction with knowledgeable colleagues. It states, that even if personally the physician does not participate in 
			research it is important that they can interpret the results and apply it to their practice. The source also explains 
			the differences in the communication among researcher to researcher and researcher to patient. It is important to know 
			the differences in order for the sharing of knowledge to be successful. 
			
			A second source explains that communication is not just in verbal form, that other forms are very vital in sharing of 
			information among the medical field. It explains the faults that can come about if communication is not present at all 
			times. Through out it describes how team collaboration is essential, and if there is any failure to do so, it will 
			create many issues, which is often an issue for a patient. In explaining when health care professionals are not 
			communicating effectively, patient safety is at risk for several reasons and it is the lack of critical information, 
			possible misinterpretation of information, and unclear orders over the telephone. 
			
			Altogether, the medical/science field has advanced and evolved thanks to communication. Literacies, research, and 
			technology are the key parts to making communication successful. Every interaction in the medical discipline is 
			dependent on these factors, and without them the field would not be where it is today. </p>
