			<h1>Anticipated Effects</h1>
			<p>Just like any social issue, it takes a lot to overcome. Discrimination can't be solved overnight, it can't be solved
			 by one person, and it can't be solved by one solution. To conquer something so complex it takes time, it takes mass 
			 amounts of people, and it take's several different actions to take place. Today people of America would say we have 
			 defeated the discrimination of skin color, some would disagree, if it was truly defeated it wouldn't be something that
			  has to be brought up anymore. In order for discrimination of same-sex marriage, it has to become something that people
			   don't think twice about. America today, is far from reaching that goal. The states have to become united in order 
			   for that to happen, people have to become united. With a social issue that goes against some beliefs, it seems 
			   impossible to ever change. The probability of someone changing their beliefs is slim to none. What some people don't
			    realize is that accepting something that goes against their beliefs doesn't change them. Convincing people of this 
			    is a long shot. Instead steps need to be taken before anything will ever be united. The best place to start would 
			    be awareness. Awareness of the derogatory language that is used all around, in media, music, and everyday 
			    conversations. People need to realize that their choice of words can be taken offensive, often people don't even 
			    realize they are saying it, so awareness would make people think before they speak. If this could disperse to peoples
			     ears, it would make a huge difference, and definitely a step into the right direction. The next step would be having 
			     "big named" people to take a positive stance against discrimination of same-sex marriage. As mentioned Macklemore's
			      music video was an example of just this. His positivity on marriage equality has gained an overwhelming acceptance. 
			      He has started a revolution, more pro-gay artist and other stars have been reaching out supporting to change the 
			      minds of people. Popular culture has an immense influence on people, they become advocates for issues like this, 
			      if they decide to eliminate their derogatory and opinions, many others will follow suit. This challenges people 
			      to really reconsider their way of life, the way they approach such issues in todays world. These two simple steps
			       are the types of things that can create a tidal wave of change. Really before anything else can happen, the majority
			        of people just need to be aware and be influenced.
