			<h1>Anticipated Effects</h1>
			<p>If the tidal wave can just keep building taller and taller, eventually with a lot of time and effort, the wave will 
			come crashing down, and America will be on its way to eliminating the discrimination of marriage equality. Prejudices 
			will need to be put aside and forgotten. The language will be different, the opinions will be different, and with the 
			unitedness the laws will be different. It doesn't just stop with a law though, a law does not determine how people act 
			and respect others. Society's view on homosexuality does not just change with a law that legalizes gay marriage. In the
			 concluding lines of the song Same Love Macklemore preaches, "No lawâ€™s gonna change us, we have to change us, whatever 
			 god you believe in we come from the same one"("Same Love Lyrics") exemplifies the fact that progress has to come from 
			 society, not the government. The effects that these solutions can have on the world is ever lasting. The way society 
			 behaves, including the way they think, will be totally different than it is now. It is easy to see how the social 
			 issue can play out, just by looking at the results of discrimination of skin color. People of any skin pigment have 
			 equal opportunities as another, they all can do the same things. Its hard to look back and think of how it used to be,
			  the fact that African American's couldn't go to "White" schools or ride the same bus as whites, or drink out of the 
			  same water fountain is astonishing. Hopefully some day discrimination of homosexuality can follow the path of this 
			  and beyond. It would be ideal for a day to come that people are not shocked that a woman married a woman or a man 
			  married a man, and that it was legal in all 50 states. And for a day, where everyone is accepted into their community
			   regardless of who they love and want to marry. And last but not least for a day that derogatory words such as 
			   "thats gay" is not used in everyday language, for it to be eliminated from the media, song lyrics, the internet, 
			   and anywhere else imaginable.
