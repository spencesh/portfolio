		<h1>Course Retrospective Project</h1>
		<p>At Michigan State University, there are many courses that are offered for students to take, most of them are required by one's desired major, some are electives, and then there are the commonly dreaded university requirements. At the top of the list sits Tier I writing: WRA 100-Level. "What does WRA even stand for?" is a common thing that incoming freshman ponder upon while sitting at their academic orientation program. A sophomore who passed the class last year would most like respond with: unfortunately that stands Writing, Rhetoric, and American Cultures. The only ones that are lucky enough to avoid taking the class are those who scored at least a four on their advance placement exam for English Language/Literature and Composition. Now not everyone dreads taking this class, but this is just a common feeling amongst those who realize they just signed up for taking it second semester of their freshman year. After almost completing the WRA 100 level course, I personally can admit that it wasn't as bad as I anticipated after hearing several rumors.</p>
		<p>	I am more of a science and math student, so when it comes to writing a paper it does not get my mind gearing like working on a math problem with my calculator. So I figured the best way to go about taking the Tier I writing requirement I would try to get the most science/math related section. With this guiding my decision, I ended up in WRA 110 Writing: Science and Technology, with the description as: "the study and practice of varieties of invention, arrangement, revision, style and delivery to help students make successful transitions to writing, reading and researching in higher education." Upon getting the class syllabus, I had a better understanding of what the class would be covering, and it gave me a sigh of relief since it seemed to interest me. We were told that our section would focus on the skills, attitudes, and knowledge to hopefully enhance reading, writing, and research in todays world, and that "specifically we would look at issues and concepts dealing with digital technology and visual rhetoric to think about what we know about literacy." This definitely made me more comfortable with the whole idea of taking an WRA, and I was no longer intimidated by the things that I heard previously. The rest of the semester did not come easy by all means, I did have to spend a lot of time in writing and researching, in order to be successful in the program.  </p>
		<p>Outside of the major projects that I will elaborate on later, we had several other things to accomplish the goals to enhance our writing, reading, and research. This included a variety of materials and activities that was spread out through the time period of the course. One major thing that we worked on throughout the semester was making an online portfolio to contain the major projects and also a blog that we worked on sporadically. This was a vital material that we had to work with to achieve dealing with digital technology. Making this website was not an easy task, many had never coded a website before, and more than likely had never used the program Github to create such portfolio. Luckily we were assigned to complete codecademy which guided us through how to code and use Github. There were also reading assignments along the course to introduce us to different literacies and rhetoric. This included chapters in two different books, and also two crucial articles: Emig and Brummett. Brummett covered three different versions of rhetoric; Ontological, Sociological, and Methodological. Emig argued about the differenced between inquiry and research. These articles gave us important insight in different rhetoric and literacies that we were then encouraged to incorporate in our own personal writings. We also had several in class activities that would help guide us in writing the major project that we would be working on simultaneously.  </p>
		<p>The first major project that we worked on was called Lived Experience. The main idea of the project was to create a story that detailed how one specific piece of technology impacted my choice for a major. For my paper I told the story of how the early detection and effectiveness of the CT scan affected my decision of majoring in pre-medicine. To elaborate on how the piece of technology impacted my decision, I described a personal experience that is close to my heart; the fact that the advancement of such technology was able to save my mothers life, by detecting a tumor early in its path before it became destructive. The literacies that I focused on the most while writing the paper was having a clear purpose: to argue how one source of technology has developed my interest in majoring in pre-med. Then to also have a strong relationship to the subject: this was tying in the personal episode to the main idea of the project. The first blog entry that we worked on was a response to a video of a man telling a very important part of his life. After watching and evaluating the strategies he used, it made it possible for me to revise and incorporate some of those literacies and rhetoric into my lived experience project. The literacies that I ended up adding into my paper was putting a lot of pathos, emotion into telling the story, I needed to get the audiences attention, and by adding emphasis on strong emotions, it allowed me to just that. With the help of the activity and getting introduced to more styles of writing, I was able to make my paper a lot stronger in accomplishing its main purpose.  </p>
		<p>	The purpose of the cultural analysis project was to elaborate on a social issue and its importance on society through the use of a cultural artifact. The social issue that I addressed was the discrimination in society on same-sex marriage, to illustrate this issue, I used the music video of Same Love by Macklemore as my cultural artifact. Discussing a social issue can be a very risky task, people have diverse and polar opposite opinions on such things, so it is important to keep the audience in mind while describing the issue, without being too biased. The best way to avoid such biases while investigating a social issue is to focus more on research rather than a single opinion. To better our writings, the class was introduced to a video from south park which went over a social issue and showed how they overcame the issue. By watching and responding to the video, it helped show that themes are important to focus on while writing a paper that is based upon analysis, and that it is important to include a clear introduction to points to cover and then to also go into detail about possible outcomes after attempts to solve an issue. Along with the basics, for the cultural analysis paper, it was necessary to include an executive summary for the project. The importance of the summary, is common to that as an abstract. The executive summary includes the main purpose and argument, introduction to things that would be later addressed, and also brief descriptions of the conclusion. This summary had a huge significance to the project and is a common literacy that is used in technical writings that commonly analyze different sorts of issues and ideas. </p>
		<p>The formal research required me to continue using the themes that I discovered from previous assignments such as having effective arrangement, style and different delivery processes. With doing the project, it introduced me to ways to incorporate research and academic discussions to develop literacy that could be used in higher education purposes. The goal of my paper was to discuss different literacies, both technological and rhetorical, that is used to communicate knowledge in the medical field. I developed different research skills to use in my writing such as using sources from scholarly articles and trade publications. I also used interviews from those who had experience in the topic to intensify my research and discussions. In order to gain these skills, I had to practice finding primary and secondary literature that could be used as effective sources which was made possible by the in class library activity. And of course a quotation from a source is not useful unless it is cited so the correct people get credit for the work, so the annotated bibliography helped advance my citing abilities. These different skills and literacies definitely lead my research and formal writing in the right direction.   </p>
		<p>Last but not least the multimedia remix project gave my group and I the opportunity to transmediate a previous project. The purpose was to strengthen the original document while also shifting the work into a different mode and genre. To help us get ideas of how to make a written document into a moving visual we analyzed several different advertisements to see what is effective visual rhetoric and what is not. The best way to have successful visuals is to have the correct balance, consistency, groupings, alignment, and contrast. If any of these are not laid out well, the documentary or video would not be as effective. So while creating our documentary our group had to keep these things in mind as well as trying to enhance our writing, so having strong literacies and rhetoric not only written but, visually and orally as well. All of these abilities and skills were put into one project to hopefully heighten and improve a previous project, while also having an effective and successful different way of displaying the information.	 </p>
		<p>After going through the major four projects, its possible to see the journey that I have taken while attending WRA 110. The activities that I participated in most certainly developed me into a better writer. I learned a lot of different literacies and uses of rhetoric and was able to use them in my assignments which in the end made my writings much more stronger. After taking WRA 110 I hope to be able to take the things that I have learned and the things that strengthened my writing abilities into any future writing experience that I am introduced to. I certainly believe that this tier one writing course has prepared me to take the next step into college and beyond writing assignments.</p>
