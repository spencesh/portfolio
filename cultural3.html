			<h1>Analysis of Artifact</h1>
			<p>Ben Haggerty known by his stage name of Macklemore is an American rapper. He is most commonly known by his number 
			one hit single "Thrift Shop" but this will not be the music video that sticks out years from now. Instead it will 
			Macklemore's fourth single "Same Love." The song addresses marriage equality, by issuing gay and lesbian rights, 
			"Same Love" was written in support of legalizing same-sex marriage, it was directly aimed at the time to support the 
			Washington Referendum 74, "AN ACT Relating to providing equal protection for all families in Washington by creating 
			equality in civil marriage and changing the domestic partnership laws, while protecting religious freedom"
			("Referendum Measure 74"). Macklemore says that marriage equality was not the only reason why he wrote the song, 
			but also to take a stand against homophobia and the use of derogatory words such as "gay" in the hip-hop industry and 
			beyond. This is the first time a male hip-hop artist has ever stood up positively for homosexuality. Normally you hear 
			rappers using derogatory words in their lyrics, but Macklemore decided otherwise, instead he wanted to make people 
			second guess their language. He raps, "If I was gay I would think hip-hop hates me, have you read the Youtube comments 
			lately "man that's gay" gets dropped on the daily we've become so numb to what we're sayin'"("Same Love Lyrics") which 
			illustrates the impact that music has on the world. He took a giant leap, risking his career to stand up for a 
			discrimination issue; for his sake and the people who he stood up for all turned out to be worth the uncertainty.
