			<h1>Technology Section</h1>
			<p>Technology has a huge impact on the medical field. Technology has changed the way that medicine is practiced. 
			Everything about the medical field has evolved with the evolution of technology. Technology has changed every aspect, 
			from the way that doctors diagnose illnesses, to how they treat illnesses. Technology has advanced surgeries, 
			treatments, drugs, almost anywhere you look in the medical field, technology has an impact, even the simple tools they 
			use have been advanced from technology. Without technology in the medical field, practitioners would not be able to do 
			a huge percentage of their work, they are very dependent on it, and so are our lives as patients. Information in the 
			medical field is commonly shared by journals, seminars, and reports. With this being said, technology has an important 
			role in the discussion of information in the field. The use of computers are needed in order to often access the 
			journals and the research of others. With this communication taking place with the aid of technology, it is advancing 
			the field as a whole; from research in a lab discovering a new bacteria, to the way doctors prognose diseases and 
			treat them as well. 
		
			In a scholarly article, a study was done in order to convince to have research go beyond its normal barriers in 
			healthcare. This was to enhance the research of technology,"With rapid improvements in technology, the ever-pressing 
			need to reduce healthcare costs, and continuing legislation emphasizing medical reforms, the demand for research within 
			the healthcare/information systems interface is growing"(Weigel). Research in the medical field is often just the 
			discovering of new bacteria, viruses, different ways of treatment, diagnosis, and surgery. Now this might include 
			researching of new technologies, but its typically never just about technology itself. If there was more research of 
			technology there could be a time of less research on the science itself because the technology could be more advanced 
			and already have the answers that would be researched.  </p>
