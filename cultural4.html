			<h1>Description of Issue</h1>
			<p> Same-sex marriage is the marriage between two people of the same biological sex and/or gender identity, it has 
			recently been identified as marriage equality by supporters in effort to pass laws allowing it to be legal in the 
			states. The discrimination of same-sex marriage isn't just looking at the legality of marrying one of the same sex, 
			instead this social issue brings a lot of baggage with it. The social issue addresses the way some are treated, some 
			are talked about, and the derogatory use of language, which all makes the whole issue even more complex and harder to 
			solve. Same-sex marriage has become a definite social issue because of the unnecessary label that is put on the gay 
			community, and it all comes down to discrimination.
