			<h1>Description of Issue</h1>
			<p>The definition of same-sex marriage states "Same-sex marriage is marriage between two people of the same biological 
			sex and/or gender identity. Legal recognition of same-sex marriage or the possibility to perform a same-sex marriage is
			 sometimes referred to as marriage equality or equal marriage, particularly by supporters," ("Same-sex marriage"). The 
			 discrimination of same-sex marriage isn't just looking at the legality of marrying one of the same sex, instead this 
			 social issue brings a lot of baggage with it. The social issue addresses the way some are treated, some are talked 
			 about, and the derogatory use of language, which all makes the whole issue even more complex and harder to solve. 
			 Same-sex marriage has become a definite social issue because of the unnecessary label that is put on the gay community,
			  and it all comes down to discrimination.</p>
