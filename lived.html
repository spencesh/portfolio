		<h1>Stiff Air</h1>
		<p>Technology has evolved into a necessity of everyday life. This evolution affects every single aspect of society today. 
		Everywhere you go, everything you touch has been impacted by technology. Some would argue that that is a bad thing, but in
		 the medical field there isn't much of a negative to it. The impact that it has had on healthcare is more apparent than 
		 anywhere else in this world. From the scalpel to the x-ray, technology has made its foot print in medicine and will 
		 continue to do so in the future. Technology has changed the relationship between the patients and the practitioners 
		 immensely, often for the better.</p>
		<p>With this positive outlook for the use of technology in medicine, it has definitely impacted my choice of wanting to 
		major in pre-med. I have been certain of going into pre medicine since high school. Upon entering college, I am now 
		determined to major in human biology, in hopes of becoming a physician assistant. Physician assistants diagnose illnesses,
		 can demand tests and interpret them, and may assist in surgery. PA’s can also take the role of a manger, where they can 
		 order lab supplies and equipment, can supervise technicians, and also order carry out and interpret lab tests such as 
		 xrays and CT scans.</p>
		<p>To become a physician assistant is a recent goal of mine, my decision was greatly impacted by the modern use of the CT 
		scan. “Computed tomography ranks as one of the top five medical developments in the last 40 years, according to most medical
		 surveys. CT has proven so valuable as a medical diagnostic tool that the 1979 Nobel Prize in Medicine was awarded to the
		  inventors,” (What). Ct scans are similar to x rays, they take detailed pictures of structures inside the body but without
		   overlapping of organs. They allow radiologists and other physicians to identify internal structures and see their shape,
		    size, and other aspects. This detailed information can be used to determine if there is a medical problem as well as
		     the severity. Ct scans has the ability to detect health issues often before they become severe and deathly, because 
		     they can acquire this information very rapidly. One of the greatest benefits of the CT scan is the improvement of 
		     cancer diagnosis and treatment. The revolution of such technology, in particular the CT scan has definitely helped me 
		     decide to go into pre med to become a physician assistant.</p>
		<p>I remember coming home from soccer practice that day, dinner was already served on the table and my parents were sitting
		 waiting patiently for my arrival. This order of events was typical, but the mood was not. Something was in the air, it was
		  stiff, I couldn’t seem to catch my breath. What could have happened in the hours while I was at practice. Thats when I 
		  remembered that my mom was waiting for her CT scan results. Did the physician call while I was gone? Was it good or bad
		   news? It must be bad news with the static in the air that I could feel shocking my heart. I was not mentally prepared 
		   for the news, but it was coming regardless whether I was ready or not. My mom opened her mouth to speak and I took a 
		   deep breath. The words came out: CANCER. There was a constant buzz through my ears, I couldn’t even hear myself chew. 
		   My mom wasn’t done explaining so I rattled my head so I could hear again. She described what the physician said, that 
		   the CT scan had caught it in time, the cancer had not yet spread from her ovary. And with fast action they could remove 
		   the whole ovary before it spread to the rest of her body. That was a relief for sure, the fact that they were able to 
		   detect it before it got too serious, before it turned malignant, saved my moms life, and saved a lot less worry for my
		    family and I. After the surgery went well, they did another CT scan to make sure they removed it in time. A couple of
		     days went by and my mom got the phone call saying all was clear, she was cancer free! A sigh of relief came out of all
		      of us. </p>
		<p>Stories of how the CT scan has affected ones life is not always this crucial. The CT scan is used multiple times a day
		 in a hospital. It can treat simple injuries, and also emergency injuries such as head trauma. My friend suffered a head 
		 injury after falling off her longboard, she was rushed the hospital after having a seizure, the doctors immediately called
		  for a CT scan to make sure there was no bleeding the brain. Luckily there was none, but without the presence of the CT 
		  scan, doctors would have not been able to detect whether or not there was bleeding, which could have cost her her life.
		   Not so seriously, a radiologist can read from the CT scan a specific injury one may have. This is common in sports 
		   injuries, where one may come in with a hurt knee, but with so many possibilities of what could actually be hurt, it is 
		   impossible to give appropriate treatment without knowing exactly what it is injured. This prevents many surgeries to take
		place, the CT scan will identify what is injured and the physician will decide the treatment from there. </p>
		<p>It is obvious on why the technology of the CT scan has impacted my decision of going into the medical field. With the 
		speed and accuracy of the CT scan it has saved many lives, including my mother, and a lot less pointless surgeries to take 
		place. This powerful tool in modern society has greatly impacted the medical field, early detection, reduced time in 
		hospitals, guiding treatments, overall just a life savor. I some day want to be able to prevent serious illnesses with the
		 help of CT scans and other technology. I want to give people hope, that although something is wrong, we have the resources
		  available to take early action and prevent future complications. I really want to be able to give patients a second chance
		   before they even know they need one. The fact that I can save someones life before they even know they need saving, is 
		   really special and can be life changing to myself. Not only to be a huge lifesaver but also to help the everyday injuries 
		   to point patients into the right direction for treatment.</p>
		   <p>With the revolution of technology in today's world, many great things have come out of it. The medical field in particular
		    has acquired great benefits from its advancement. With this continuum of escalation, going into human biology I will get 
		    first hand benefits. In my everyday work schedule I will be able see and personally go through events that are impacted
		     by technology. More often than not, these will be positive influences. I will get to help and save patients that I might
		    not have been able to in the past without the presence of the CT scan. Every day I will be thankful for this invention 
		    in technology that has once saved my moms life, and will forever save my patients lives.</p>
