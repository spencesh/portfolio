		<h1>Remix Memo</h1>
		<p>In choosing the issue to evaluate had a huge impact on composing our project. First off we picked to remix a cultural 
		analysis paper that was previously written. The issue that was decided to elaborate more in depth was the issue of asian 
		stereotypes in American entertainment business. So to compose the project we had to approach it directly, by first seeing 
		if there was an actual stereotype that existed. We used the artifact, Gangnam Style music video from the cultural analysis 
		paper, but had to use two opposite parodies to evaluate if there was an actual stereotype present, we used an eastern 
		version and a western version to do so. Then we had to use the evidence to actually support the hypothesis that asian 
		stereotypes had an impact in the entertainment business. So overall picking the issue, constructed the way we composed our 
		project, by introducing the issue, coming up with a way to prove that it is an issue, and hopefully to create an impact on 
		the audience. </p>
		<p>For me personally, before coming across this idea for the project I had never thought twice about the possible issue of 
		asian stereotypes. I never recognized how much of an impact the subconscious stereotype that I had that fit into the 
		common stereotype that exists in America had on my thoughts. Composing this project definitely helped me first realize 
		that the stereotype exists, and is prominent in myself, and also helped me understand the issue in general, that the issue 
		of stereotypes plays a huge role in the entertainment business. My goal for understanding the issue more in depth is to 
		open my eyes when viewing such music videos or movies today and really think about stereotypes and how they are affecting 
		my point of view, and to hopefully be able to be more accepting and see beyond the humor in Asian actors, singers, or just 
		an average day to day person of Asian culture. And hopefully to share the knowledge that I gained from doing this project 
		to others and hopefully someday change the way the entertainment business functions in America.	</p>
		<p>The biggest problems that we encountered in composing the documentary was deciding how we would prove that the issue 
		exists. We had difficulties in deciding who to interview to have the biggest evidence to show, this included if we needed 
		to interview all American culture, or should we show the opposing view, that of Asian culture to see if there was an 
		actual stereotype. We ended up deciding to show just those that of American culture, because the point was to show 
		American stereotypes on Asians, not Asian stereotypes on Americans. Unfortunately, I do believe we should have at least 
		included one view of Asian culture to identify if there was a difference in views from Americans to Asians, because if 
		they responded with the same response as an American person, the stereotypes would not just exist in American culture, but 
		rather even Asians find themselves more humorous than Americans. So I do believe that if we would have included an Asian 
		viewpoint that responded with the fact that they thought the western video was more humorous, that our evidence would have 
		been a lot stronger than what it is now with no opposing cultures and perspectives.     </p>
		<p>Audience was a huge role in our project. This made the whole basis for the project. We wanted the documentary to be 
		interesting to the audience, but not only that, we wanted it to be beneficial for the audience. We wanted the audience to 
		be able to get something out of it,in hopes of leaving them thinking, do they have a stereotype that affects how they view 
		the entertainment business as well along with the interviewees. So as we went about the project we were always trying to 
		address the people that were to view our documentary. The audience could be of any diversity, no matter their culture or 
		age, it would affect them personally and hopefully leave them with an open mind.   </p>
		<p>The first day, of being introduced the project, we started choosing what issue we wanted to evaluate. One group member 
		explained to us a possible issue to address. We all liked the idea, it seemed intriguing and an issue that was able to 
		work off easily. Personally I was excited to remix the project; the issue of stereotypes on asians, since I had not really 
		thought about the impact that it had on making the music video Gangnam Style so popular. We also felt that the audience 
		would not get bored with the documentary since it is an interesting topic, and many people have seen and heard the song 
		before, so they could have feelings similar to me when I was first introduced to it.   </p>
		<p>The most challenging part of the project for me was making sure the whole group new how we were going to approach the 
		problem. Having the most supportive evidence was key to making this project successful. The ideas that were bounced back 
		and forth never had a clear cut idea as to how we were going to do this. I think as we all interviewed separately and came 
		up with conclusions from the evidence was a bit confusing on how to make it the best way to support our hypothesis. This 
		was definitely the most challenging, and we should have spent more time on really understanding on how we were to approach 
		the issue and to come up with evidence that supported the issue the best.  We attempted to take a systematic approach, we 
		wanted to have a system for each person to have similar ways of getting information and evidence. We knew what we were 
		trying to achieve in the project, that we wanted to show that there is a stereotype on asian cultures, and we created a 
		method by asking appropriate questions to ask our interviewees in hopes of getting responses that would do just that. The 
		evidence that was used, each had the same system, to get to the conclusion that our evidence supported our hypothesis.  </p>
		<p>The research resources that proved as the most beneficial	were the ones that were used in the original writing of 
		the cultural analysis. These were ones that identified that there is a stereotypes for asians, and that it does impact the 
		way the entertainment business functions in America. The resources that were also beneficial were the one's that identified 
		that the stereotypes affected the way Gangnam style became so popular. The research was useful in identifying that there 
		are differences in the way that Asians and Americans view the Asian culture. There weren't any real research resources 
		that were not beneficial. For the most part all the resources fit into our hypothesis and was able to be used in our 
		documentary.   </p>
		<p>Communication and interaction of our group for this project was a definite setback. There were clearly communication 
		barriers that was needed to overcome in order for us to be able to work together. The best way for me to communicate with 
		my group was over email, talking in class was not really the best option since it was hard to communicate. We could not 
		come up with legit and concrete ideas and ways to go about our project. This was the biggest fall back, and it was something 
		we had to attempt to overcome before getting anywhere in our project. Once we started emailing and texting each other, it 
		was easier to start getting ideas flowing and actual steps at completing the project. We tried our best to have equal 
		interaction in completing the project. Unfortunately only myself worked on the proposal for the project, they did read 
		over it, but had no extra input on information for it. So once it was time to start creating the project the others 
		started to input their information, so it started to alter from the proposal, which wasn't a big deal, just would have 
		been nice to have while creating the proposal. On the positive side of things, we did split up the work nicely, we decided 
		we would each do an interview to have as evidence. Some of us did an introduction and a conclusion, and then some who was 
		more techy put more work into putting the whole project together and editing. Overall, I did not mind how the work was 
		split up, it seemed to be an equal sharing of input.  </p>
		<p>This was a good project to work in a group. We were able to bounce off ideas for what issue we wanted to address and 
		how we wanted go about it. I think working in the group made it for people to open their eyes to more ideas and 
		perspectives that exist in the world. If it was a project that was not of a group, this sharing of ideas and viewpoints 
		would have been eliminated and I think it would have made the point of the project less impactful. Otherwise we would have 
		each just been going back over one of our own projects and would have had repeatable information and ultimately the 
		project would not have been exactly remixed. Planning the work for the project could have been done a lot more efficiently. 
		Deciding on a issue took some time, but once a good idea was brought upon, it was easy to quickly take steps in completing 
		the project. In conclusion, we had our ideas and ways we wanted to approach the project planned out well, it was just 
		actually completing what was said to be done was the only thing that wasn't as planned. Definitely if we had more time, 
		we would have been able to meet more and work on the project together more. There was a lot of time that was spent apart 
		working on the project rather than time together as a group, so that is for sure something that I would do differently. If 
		we had spent more time working on it together, we all would have had a better concept on what we wanted to complete in the 
		project and then we would have also had a more equal share of effort from each other.   </p>
		<p>The most effective aspect of our documentary was to hopefully get the audience attention, we picked an intriguing topic 
		that concerned most of the world, since most of the world has viewed the Gangnam style music video. The effectiveness of 
		the documentary was that our evidence supported our hypothesis, the audience could see the evidence and use it to their 
		everyday life and their stereotypes. Our design for the documentary was being informational, most documentaries that is 
		severely information come across as boring, but I believe that our information is interesting to most audiences and it 
		will get their attention and leave them with thoughts going through their heads. I wish that after viewing the documentary 
		it will be effective in opening the eyes and ears of people addressing their stereotypes, it definitely did for me, so I 
		have a good feeling that it will do just that. Overall the project came together, by making our design decisions by first 
		introducing the issue at hand. We showed clips of the music videos, to show the audience what the interviewees had watched 
		so they could apply it to themselves personally. We then showed the interviews as evidence, which then would hopefully get 
		the audiences minds going and identify that they too have these common stereotypes. We then made a conclusion to wrap it 
		all up, to show how the evidence relates to the overall issue, and the hypothesis. </p>
