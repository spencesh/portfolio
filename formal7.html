			<h1>Conclusion</h1>
			<p>All in all, communication is how the medical field has evolved and advanced, without it, it would not be where it 
			is today, and everyone would end up being impacted by it if they are ever a patient to a health care professionals. In 
			the medical field, everything is down to the wire of successful communication or not, behind the scenes in research, or 
			in live action in a hospital. Literacies play a role, verbally and visually	, it's a crucial step in communication, 
			without it, there would be no effective transformation of information. Research will always be a part in the science 
			and medical discipline, with the evolution of new information, and the high demand for new and better knowledge, it 
			will always be something that is needed to communicate towards and from. Technology is piecing the puzzle together for 
			the communication in medicine, it has advanced the field immensely and will always continue to do so. Writing, reading, 
			and research are the primary ways that literacies both rhetorical and technological, are used to discover and 
			communicate knowledge in the medical/science field.</p>
