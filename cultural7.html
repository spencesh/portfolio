			<h1>Conclusion</h1>
			<p>Same-sex marriage is a definite social issue based upon discrimination. Discrimination has been a way of life since 
			the beginning of time. People can't seem to handle that there are others that are different from them, that they look 
			different, or talk different, or believe different. For some reason society can't accept the fact that there exists no 
			two identical snowflakes, and that gives them the okay to treat them differently just based on their diversity. As time
			 moves on, people have become more and more accepting, society is getting closer to a less discriminate world. For the 
			 most part, racial discrimination has become something of the past. In the occurring era, same-sex marriage is the major
			  social issue. It's hard to confront the issue with the fact that many people believe to accept it into the community 
			  it goes against their personal beliefs, it's not a matter of convincing them that it is right or wrong, but rather 
			  convincing them to accept the fact that people should be able to love and marry who they wish without getting hatred 
			  from the people around them. With the recent trend of awareness and advocates supporting marriage equality America is
			   taking a step in the right direction that is needed to make the discrimination a thing of the past. Macklemore's 
			   song Same Love had a huge impact in leading this transformation, and its things like that that will change the world
			    for better. These are the steps that are required in order to solve the conflict, only time and the power of the 
			    people will bring the success the world needs to end discrimination concerning marriage equality and the acceptance
			     of all in to our community.
