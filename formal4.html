			<h1>Communication Section</h1>
			<p>Looking directly at a hospital setting, there are too many interactions to count, all interactions that involve the 
			sharing of information from one person to the next. In a hospital today, there is a numerous amount of handing off 
			knowledge among multiple health care practitioners in which that varies in educational training to patients of all 
			sorts. This sets up an ideal environment for errors if communication is not present at all times. 	When health care 
			providers are not communicating at 100% effectiveness,  patient lives are at hand. A single misinterpretation of 
			information, a single miss of critical information discussed, a single unclear order, can trigger an avoidable 
			emergency in a hospital. These medical errors, that are caused by miscommunication, are becoming a very common problem 
			in todays health care, it is causing way too many deaths then it should ever be. 
			
			When one thinks of communication, they often think of just the verbal form. Where one person talks, the other listens, 
			and then cycles back and forth. These people aren't talking in monotone, with no facial expression or body movement. A 
			crucial part of someone interpreting the information they are listening to is portrayed through the visual aspects. 
			What tone is it being said in, what is their body language saying, is there any emotion behind it. It is easier to 
			recall how a person felt about the topic rather than what they said about the topic. In consequence this can cause 
			many issues, this causes a huge portion of the miscommunication taking place. Communication error is the number one 
			reason for human error. A second scholar article states that, "strong verbal communication skills are key whether for 
			establishing a shared mental model, coordinating tasks, centralizing the flow of information, or stabilizing emotions" 
			(Brindley), in a crisis these vital goals are addressed by verbal communication. With this in mind, literacies are 
			crucial to avoid any miscommunication. In the medical field, it is important to have every participant on the team be 
			up to date on their literacies to have successful communication. Performing at its best, communication encourages 
			cooperation, aides teamwork, and helps prevent errors. 
			
			Analyzing a third scholar article, it discusses the fact that the science and medicine field is lacking a common 
			language to be shared through out. In the medical discipline, the primary communication is that of what a doctor says 
			rather than how they say something, "these latter elements of communication, which often carry the emotional content 
			of the discourse, are usually referred to as interpersonal skills. Although recognized as important by some educators, 
			interpersonal skills have received much less attention than task-oriented, verbal aspects in the medical field" (Dyche). 
			The field has yet to identify a common language that would be ideal for a physician to have effective relationships 
			with their patients. Interpersonal skills is a literacy in itself, a rhetorical literacy that is not written or spoken, 
			"nonverbal communication includes extra textual elements of a face-to-face exchange such as posture, facial expression, 
			and dress, and it can support, modify, or even contradict verbal messages" (Dyche). These skills are important to 
			perfect, since often a patient can identify the outcome just by the tone or eye contact of the doctor before they even 
			speak. As described, interpersonal skills is a crucial literacy that needs to exist in the medical discipline. 
			
			I interviewed an older friend who works in the medical field, specifically; a home for disabled patients. She went 
			into detail of how information was shared at her job, "everywhere you look, it is apparent that communication is very 
			important anywhere in a medical setting, researcher to researcher, researcher to doctor, doctor to doctor, doctor to 
			nurse, nurse to patient, the chain of information wouldn't exist without some sort of communication. This communication 
			is not always auditory, its also visually, such as using technology to see information on the web. Without having 
			communication and technology at my job, it would be pointless, it would be just a bunch of people walking around not 
			knowing what they are looking at" (Jessica). She walked me through the average day at the home, that physicians would 
			tell her what she needed to do; who to care for, and how to care for them. She informed me that most of the patients 
			are hooked up to different machines, and without them they couldn't survive. After listening to her explain her typical 
			day, it was easy to see how the importance of careful and precise communication is very important especially when 
			someones life is at hand. </p>
