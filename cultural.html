			<h1>Executive Summary</h1>
			<p>Discrimination of same-sex marriage has become a major social issue in the world. It goes beyond the legality to 
			marry one of the same-sex, rather it includes the way homosexuals are accepted into society, directly looking at the
			 use of derogatory language that can be come off as offensive. The artifact that is used is the music video Same Love 
			 by Macklemore. Macklemore raps about how slang is used everywhere in the music industry and it has become something 
			 that is just ignored rather than being recognized as wrong. He also determines in order for progress it has to be 
			 something that society decides, making a law without the support of the people behind it will get it no where close
			  to being solved. The solution to this issue is awareness and well-known advocates to take a positive stance, which 
			  will domino effect and influence more and more people to take a stand. Its not a matter of changing people's beliefs
			   but rather convincing them that what someone else is, does, or believes does not change their personal beliefs at
			    all, its just something that needs to be accepted. With time and the acceptance from society, discrimination of 
			    marriage equality will eventually diminish. With persistence it will become something of the past, and will no 
			    longer be something that is brought into the minds of people daily.</p>
