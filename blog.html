		<h1>blog entry 1</h1>
		<p>The video was of Randy Potts telling a story using a letter to his deceased uncle, Ronnie, who 
		committed suicide in 1982 after years of struggling with his own sexuality. The purpose of the video was
		to explain that things get better. He wanted to share the story of the over comings of his own struggle to get 
		through his hard time. He wanted to spread the message to others the fact that life will go on, that it will all be
		worth fighting for. For Randy he had no example to follow. All he had was someone who gave up hope, who ran from
		himself and everyone else. Randy wanted to give a positive example to ones that are struggling just like he did, so he 
		shared the video to all who wanted to watch.  </p>
		<p>The video attempts to achieve its purpose by using extreme pathos. He uses a lot of emotion into telling the story.
		The way he words the story, with the emotion in his voice, and along with the emotion on his face, people can feel for him
		on an emotional level. They can see the pain that he has gone through. People began to feel connected to him whether or not
		they have gone through anything similar to him. Reading through the comments on the video it is obvious that it has done 
		just this. </p>
		<p>The structure of the message was as if he was writing a journal entry. He had not planned on sharing his story to just anyone.
		He started the whole video message by sharing a poem, so open the eyes of everyone who could be viewing, he wanted to interest
		all audiences. He opened himself up and told a true story. We received vivid imagery of all things that he went through. 
		He wrote it in sequence of the things that happened with adding personal feelings and emotions in it.</p>
		<p>This video's structure can help me revise my Lived Experiences project by adding more emotion in to it. I will need to
		change it to be less direct. Rather I need to act as if I am just writing a story that may not ever be shared to a superior.
		I need to have a less concrete connection and rather just have it flow to become interesting to almost anyone. The part in which
		I share my personal story needs to have emotion, other wise it is just plain and dull. </p>
		<h1>blog entry 2</h1>
		<p>After being introduced the lived experience project, I had to get into the narrative writing mindset. For the project, I needed to go 
		into depth of describing many different things. Going into depth in things, can be very tricky. If one is to describe an experience, the 
		core to the description include emotion, so the audience can feel as if they were right next to you going through the same experience. 
		Getting this down path is what will make my lived experience strong. I need to go back in time and relive everything that had happened, 
		how I felt, what I was thinking, anything to really set the setting. The video that we previously watched was a good way to show how we 
		should get the point across in our own writings. They way he explain the story rather than just saying what happened, really informed of 
		how to explain my experience. Rather than being informative the whole paper, it needed to be descriptive as well. An important thing to 
		remember while writing the paper, is to make sure that my anecdote is always focusing on the purpose of the whole paper. It's easy to get 
		consumed by the story and forget what the purpose of telling the story was in the first place. With watching the video, it definitely 
		helped me get into the right narrative voice to construct my paper. I learned a lot, mostly how to include a voice in the project, to not 
		sound do formal, but to really get my voice and feeling portrayed while telling and explaining the story that is connected to the main 
		purpose.

		<h1>blog entry 3</h1>
		<p>
		After reading chapters 5 and 14 out of McGraw-Hill guide, I gained  more insight on how to make my lived experience project final project 
		even stronger. When writing for other people, I needed to make legit choices based upon my audience, purpose, voice and tone, and context, 
		medium, and genre. Which differs from what the way that one would write if they were just writing to themselves, since it doesn't have to 
		be written in any particular way. I needed to focus on the short narratives in my life that are inside my long narrative known was my life. 
		To have an effective way of writing my experience, I needed to construct a clear sense of purpose. In order for my readers to learn 
		something from my paper, I needed to reflect on the significance of the experience that I shared. Tone is an important step in this. To 
		show significance is to explain, with examples, on how the experience affected me. To share it effectively, the way I express my language 
		tone and details will help make my point. To have my narrative lively, it needs to include the who, what, where, when, why and how. This 
		can be written by using dialogue, which is very successful in revealing the personalities of the people in my experience. Vivid description 
		as always is important, can get my audience involved in my writing, they start getting personal feelings for the actual people without even 
		knowing them on a personal level. Getting this down path, will help make my piece memorable to the audience. After reading the chapters, I 
		learned alot of strategies to make my paper more narrative.

		<h1>blog entry 4</h1>
		<p>
		As we continued with our lived experience project, I was introduced to several strategies of making a narrative essay productive. Four more 
		chapter were read out of the McGraw-Hill guide. The chapters covered, different rhetorical knowledge, rhetorical situations, writers voice 
		and tone, context, medium, and genre, using rhetorical analysis, critical thinking, reading and writing, and also composing in electronic 
		environments. The lived experience had to be turned in, in two forms, an electron written document, and also a version for the web. Having 
		to write for a web version changed the way that I would use and write rhetorical strategies to fit into the situation of the type of media 
		that my project would be portrayed on. Now a days many people send text messages, email, and update their facebook statuses using technology. 
		The strategies that I used in my paper had to be much different than the way that I would update my status or email a friend. So as usual 
		audience was important in writing the lived experience, especially with the fact that it was going on the web, which means almost anyone in 
		the world could eventually access it. As we had to make this into a web version, we were introduced to a web coding website called Github, 
		which would be the way we were going to upload our work to the internet. Working on this web making site would take much practice to get a 
		hang of in order for me to be able to successfully upload web versions.

		<p>The group of people that are targeted in the video are ones who stand up for what is right, for the good of the people in the
		world. This is commonly known as an advocate. An advocate is someone who steps out of their comfort zone to do what is the right thing in the
		situation.</p>
		<p>The social issue that this video tries to portray is doing what is right in the world. Such as, that if you know that someone
		is doing something wrong, the right thing would to do is to take a stand against it and do something about it to make it right.
		If you take a stand on something that you truly believe in, you have the power to make it that way. It might take a lot time and failures to get there, but in the end 
		its the right thing to do, there should be nothing to stop you from doing it. These people who become advocated typically 
		influence other people to follow in their footsteps to make a difference in the world as well.</p>
		<p>The video's creator did a good job on showing this social issue based upon the way the show is. Although this type 
		of video is not my preference, they do get the point across successfully. They showed people giving up which is very typical for someone
		going against odds, but through perseverance and the help of others, the right thing can and will be done. The video presented the issue, 
		and then took time in showing how to fix by the issue by introducing an advocate, this will be a strategy that I will use while writing
		my cultural analysis paper.  </p>

		<p>Advertisement is everywhere we look, its there when we watch tv, listen to the radio, surf the web, driving down the high
		way. Now a days its hard to avoid. Our eyes and ears are bombarded with advertising constantly, telling us what to buy, what
		what to like, what to eat, it's impossible to run away from. Many think that it has no impact on their decisions or feelings.
		This is highly unlikely, especially when the advertisement uses several strategies to get ones attention. Chrysler did just
		this in their super bowl commercial, and it was very effective.</p>
		<p> The advertisement was promoting the Chrysler 200, but not just that, it also promoted the motor city, Detroit. Probably,
		one of the most intriguing commercial I have ever seen, so yes I would indeed say it was effective. The ad used several strategies,
		focusing on just a couple specifically, the voiceover, with the imagery of Detroit in the background, and the tagline "imported from 
		Detroit.". The voiceover starts out with a couple of questions, including, "What does a town that’s been to hell and back 
		know about the finer things in life?" This gets people's emotions going, if they can relate, such as if they have ever lived
		in Detroit, or was ever affected by the economy. The voiceovers tone is perfect for getting peoples attention, and fits 
		perfectly into the setting. Half the time, the things it says relates both to the city and the car, such as when talking
		about luxury. It summed up the hopes that people have for the city to get back on its feet. This voiceover fit in perfectly
		with the images in Ad. It started with showing factories, signs pointing to Detroit, and once the voiceover mentioned Detroit,
		it went straight to downtown. Showing the brilliance of the buildings, from of a time where the city was wealthy, is left
		behind in the dust as America moved on. The tagline, "Imported from Detroit" was very effective in itself, combined luxury 
		with the pride people have for city, even though people on the outside make it seem like an alienated city, thats isolated 
		outside of the United States.  </p>
		<p> All of these strategies that Chrysler added into its advertisement was beyond effective. Every single aspect was perfect
		for getting its point across, trying to motivate positive thoughts about the city as well as promoting the car. If it would
		have just been a normal car commercial, where its all about the car, the ad more than likely wouldn't have received as much
		attention as it did.</p>
