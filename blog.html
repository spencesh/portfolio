		<p>The video was of Randy Potts telling a story using a letter to his deceased uncle, Ronnie, who 
		committed suicide in 1982 after years of struggling with his own sexuality. The purpose of the video was
		to explain that things get better. He wanted to share the story of the over comings of his own struggle to get 
		through his hard time. He wanted to spread the message to others the fact that life will go on, that it will all be
		worth fighting for. For Randy he had no example to follow. All he had was someone who gave up hope, who ran from
		himself and everyone else. Randy wanted to give a positive example to ones that are struggling just like he did, so he 
		shared the video to all who wanted to watch.  </p>
		<p>The video attempts to achieve its purpose by using extreme pathos. He uses a lot of emotion into telling the story.
		The way he words the story, with the emotion in his voice, and along with the emotion on his face, people can feel for him
		on an emotional level. They can see the pain that he has gone through. People began to feel connected to him whether or not
		they have gone through anything similar to him. Reading through the comments on the video it is obvious that it has done 
		just this. </p>
		<p>The structure of the message was as if he was writing a journal entry. He had not planned on sharing his story to just anyone.
		He started the whole video message by sharing a poem, so open the eyes of everyone who could be viewing, he wanted to interest
		all audiences. He opened himself up and told a true story. We received vivid imagery of all things that he went through. 
		He wrote it in sequence of the things that happened with adding personal feelings and emotions in it.</p>
		<p>This video's structure can help me revise my Lived Experiences project by adding more emotion in to it. I will need to
		change it to be less direct. Rather I need to act as if I am just writing a story that may not ever be shared to a superior.
		I need to have a less concrete connection and rather just have it flow to become interesting to almost anyone. The part in which
		I share my personal story needs to have emotion, other wise it is just plain and dull. </p>
		<h1>blog entry 2</h1>
		<p>After being introduced the lived experience project, I had to get into the narrative writing mindset. For the project, I needed to go 
		into depth of describing many different things. Going into depth in things, can be very tricky. If one is to describe an experience, the 
		core to the description include emotion, so the audience can feel as if they were right next to you going through the same experience. 
		Getting this down path is what will make my lived experience strong. I need to go back in time and relive everything that had happened, 
		how I felt, what I was thinking, anything to really set the setting. The video that we previously watched was a good way to show how we 
		should get the point across in our own writings. They way he explain the story rather than just saying what happened, really informed of 
		how to explain my experience. Rather than being informative the whole paper, it needed to be descriptive as well. An important thing to 
		remember while writing the paper, is to make sure that my anecdote is always focusing on the purpose of the whole paper. It's easy to get 
		consumed by the story and forget what the purpose of telling the story was in the first place. With watching the video, it definitely 
		helped me get into the right narrative voice to construct my paper. I learned a lot, mostly how to include a voice in the project, to not 
		sound do formal, but to really get my voice and feeling portrayed while telling and explaining the story that is connected to the main 
		purpose.
		</p>

		<p>
		After reading chapters 5 and 14 out of McGraw-Hill guide, I gained  more insight on how to make my lived experience project final project 
		even stronger. When writing for other people, I needed to make legit choices based upon my audience, purpose, voice and tone, and context, 
		medium, and genre. Which differs from what the way that one would write if they were just writing to themselves, since it doesn't have to 
		be written in any particular way. I needed to focus on the short narratives in my life that are inside my long narrative known was my life. 
		To have an effective way of writing my experience, I needed to construct a clear sense of purpose. In order for my readers to learn 
		something from my paper, I needed to reflect on the significance of the experience that I shared. Tone is an important step in this. To 
		show significance is to explain, with examples, on how the experience affected me. To share it effectively, the way I express my language 
		tone and details will help make my point. To have my narrative lively, it needs to include the who, what, where, when, why and how. This 
		can be written by using dialogue, which is very successful in revealing the personalities of the people in my experience. Vivid description 
		as always is important, can get my audience involved in my writing, they start getting personal feelings for the actual people without even 
		knowing them on a personal level. Getting this down path, will help make my piece memorable to the audience. After reading the chapters, I 
		learned alot of strategies to make my paper more narrative. 
		</p>
		<h1>blog entry 4</h1>
		<p>
		As we continued with our lived experience project, I was introduced to several strategies of making a narrative essay productive. Four more 
		chapter were read out of the McGraw-Hill guide. The chapters covered, different rhetorical knowledge, rhetorical situations, writers voice 
		and tone, context, medium, and genre, using rhetorical analysis, critical thinking, reading and writing, and also composing in electronic 
		environments. The lived experience had to be turned in, in two forms, an electron written document, and also a version for the web. Having 
		to write for a web version changed the way that I would use and write rhetorical strategies to fit into the situation of the type of media 
		that my project would be portrayed on. Now a days many people send text messages, email, and update their facebook statuses using technology. 
		The strategies that I used in my paper had to be much different than the way that I would update my status or email a friend. So as usual 
		audience was important in writing the lived experience, especially with the fact that it was going on the web, which means almost anyone in 
		the world could eventually access it. As we had to make this into a web version, we were introduced to a web coding website called Github, 
		which would be the way we were going to upload our work to the internet. Working on this web making site would take much practice to get a 
		hang of in order for me to be able to successfully upload web versions.

		<h1>blog entry 5</h1>
		<p>The group of people that are targeted in the video are ones who stand up for what is right, for the good of the people in the
		world. This is commonly known as an advocate. An advocate is someone who steps out of their comfort zone to do what is the right thing in the
		situation.</p>
		<p>The social issue that this video tries to portray is doing what is right in the world. Such as, that if you know that someone
		is doing something wrong, the right thing would to do is to take a stand against it and do something about it to make it right.
		If you take a stand on something that you truly believe in, you have the power to make it that way. It might take a lot time and failures to get there, but in the end 
		its the right thing to do, there should be nothing to stop you from doing it. These people who become advocated typically 
		influence other people to follow in their footsteps to make a difference in the world as well.</p>
		<p>The video's creator did a good job on showing this social issue based upon the way the show is. Although this type 
		of video is not my preference, they do get the point across successfully. They showed people giving up which is very typical for someone
		going against odds, but through perseverance and the help of others, the right thing can and will be done. The video presented the issue, 
		and then took time in showing how to fix by the issue by introducing an advocate, this will be a strategy that I will use while writing
		my cultural analysis paper.  </p>
		<h1>blog entry 6</h1>
		<p>
		The next project that we were introduced was the cultural analysis paper. We were asked to investigate a specific social issue and its 
		import on society through the analysis of a cultural artifact. It was mentioned that formal proposals are a significant type of document in 
		the technical workplace. After reading chapter 8 in the Guide, I learned more about an analysis paper. First off, analysis means to examine 
		an issue or topic by introducing the parts that make up the whole concept. As the writer, it is capable of getting a clearer understanding 
		of the subject by looking closely as the smaller individual pieces of the conflict. When writing an analysis its a good idea to keep in mind 
		who will benefit from the analysis, what do people already probably know about the issue, and what is important to tell them. In analyzing 
		a conflict it helps others understand the subject at hand. When writing an analysis, one should break down the topic into different parts 
		so its easier to understand. The tone in writing should help increase the trust the readers will get with the writer. What helped me the 
		most in starting to write my analysis was brainstorming and listing to help me consider different parts of the topic to get a clear 
		connection between them. One big issue that I had in my topic was that it was very vague, I needed to slim it down to one clear part and go 
		into detail about that part specifically. 
		</p>
		<h1>blog entry 7</h1>
		<p>
		Outside of reading chapters in our textbooks, we were introduced to two different articles. One was called Emig and the other Brummett. 
		They were used to help enhance our rhetoric in our writings, both the cultural analysis and and also the formal research paper that we were 
		just introduced to. The Brummett article went over three different types of rhetoric. The three types of rhetoric were Methodological, 
		Sociological, and Ontological. Methodological discussed that rhetoric is a mean of discovery of the truth and a path to knowledge. This 
		rhetoric will lead people to understand the truth about a topic. Sociological focused on the social aspect of rhetoric. Rather than getting 
		into facts since that doesn't require rhetoric, rhetoric invades social issues. Ontological explained that rhetoric creates all of that 
		there is to know, and there is no way of every avoiding rhetoric in life. Emig touched more on things that will be used in making the 
		formal research paper. Emig touched on the contradiction of inquiry vs research. The Inquiry paradigm is that its a conscious set of 
		assumptions. Which is the exact opposite of research since that is merely based on facts rather than assumptions. These two articles helped 
		enhance my cultural analysis paper, and helped open my mind different rhetoric to use in my formal research paper, since when it really 
		comes down to it, rhetoric is the basis of any paper regardless of the topic or audience, it will always be there if one was to follow the 
		ontological point of view that is.

		As we were introduced to the formal research paper, we were suggested to continue to use effective arrangement, style, and delivery 
		practices. While also incorporating ways to introduce research into the work, and also to participate in academic and informative 
		discussions to prepare myself to use such literacy in higher education. Research was going to be a large part in writing this paper. Many 
		conflicts come into play when writing research paper. One of these major issues is plagiarism. By reading the 3rd chapter in The Curious 
		Researcher, I was informed of the basics of plagiarism, what it is, and why it matters. To avoid doing this, the textbook informed me of 
		ways to do so, which included using quotations, paraphrasing and summaries. It's easy to cite, summarize, paraphrase, and quote correctly, 
		but the hard part is making use of what I just read and took notes on. The book also informed me of ways to do advance searching and 
		techniques, this is to vary terms, search different databases, check different bibliographies. Another chapter in the Curious Researcher 
		helped me construct a thesis, which is very very important in writing a research paper. It is the basis of all research papers, and without 
		an effective thesis statement the whole paper would lose its effectiveness. Reading the chapters in the book, really helped me start out 
		with my paper, with informing me of different strategies to use while first drafting my paper. I would still have much to do to complete a 
		rough draft for the project, but it definitely did help me get started. 
		</p>
		<h1>blog entry 9</h1>
		<p>
		When it came down to creating the formal research paper, the activities that we did in class were the most successful in helping me 
		actually write the paper. This included the library activity, annotated bibliography, and the complete drafting activity. The library 
		activity helped me come up with effective ways of finding sources to use in my paper. I had several attempts at coming up key words to 
		search for to get the right sources that would relate to my topic of the research paper. This activity definitely helped me find correct 
		sources. The annotated bibliography helped me read and annotate the sources and be able to get the right material out of it to use in the 
		research paper. As said before, the most important step is to make use of what I was going to cite. I needed to make these sources key 
		evidence for my topic. I can't just throw random statements in my paper, they needed to have a very important significance, and hopefully 
		could go off of those to run more ideas through it. In the drafting activity we were told to make an executive summary. This was the first 
		time I was going to have to write such summary, so I had to research on my own on how to make an effective executive summary. Before I had 
		no idea what to include in the summary and how to portray the information. So doing these activities to make a final copy really helped 
		develop skills that will be needed later in my school career and possibly an actual career.

		<p>Advertisement is everywhere we look, its there when we watch tv, listen to the radio, surf the web, driving down the high
		way. Now a days its hard to avoid. Our eyes and ears are bombarded with advertising constantly, telling us what to buy, what
		what to like, what to eat, it's impossible to run away from. Many think that it has no impact on their decisions or feelings.
		This is highly unlikely, especially when the advertisement uses several strategies to get ones attention. Chrysler did just
		this in their super bowl commercial, and it was very effective.</p>
		<p> The advertisement was promoting the Chrysler 200, but not just that, it also promoted the motor city, Detroit. Probably,
		one of the most intriguing commercial I have ever seen, so yes I would indeed say it was effective. The ad used several strategies,
		focusing on just a couple specifically, the voiceover, with the imagery of Detroit in the background, and the tagline "imported from 
		Detroit.". The voiceover starts out with a couple of questions, including, "What does a town that’s been to hell and back 
		know about the finer things in life?" This gets people's emotions going, if they can relate, such as if they have ever lived
		in Detroit, or was ever affected by the economy. The voiceovers tone is perfect for getting peoples attention, and fits 
		perfectly into the setting. Half the time, the things it says relates both to the city and the car, such as when talking
		about luxury. It summed up the hopes that people have for the city to get back on its feet. This voiceover fit in perfectly
		with the images in Ad. It started with showing factories, signs pointing to Detroit, and once the voiceover mentioned Detroit,
		it went straight to downtown. Showing the brilliance of the buildings, from of a time where the city was wealthy, is left
		behind in the dust as America moved on. The tagline, "Imported from Detroit" was very effective in itself, combined luxury 
		with the pride people have for city, even though people on the outside make it seem like an alienated city, thats isolated 
		outside of the United States.  </p>
		<p> All of these strategies that Chrysler added into its advertisement was beyond effective. Every single aspect was perfect
		for getting its point across, trying to motivate positive thoughts about the city as well as promoting the car. If it would
		have just been a normal car commercial, where its all about the car, the ad more than likely wouldn't have received as much
		attention as it did.</p>
		<h1>blog entry 11</h1>
		<p>
		After being introduced to the Multimedia project, the advertisement that we had just watched helped give insight to what it takes to have 
		an effective visual media at portraying something. Its beyond that pictures in the background, or the words moving across the screen, or 
		the commentary being spoken, or the music being played, its all of them together in a balanced form. They way the Chrysler commercial got 
		its point across to the audience, were the same footsteps that my group and I needed to follow in to be able to have a successful 
		documentary of a previous project. The pictures we include, the things we say, and the music that is played, all need to have an underlying 
		meaning, it can't just be random. Everything is important in making it successful. When making a visual method, its important to realize 
		that the audience will be more interested in what there is visually that what is being said, so it's important to make the informative 
		auditory sound interesting. This includes on how something is being said, so tone and language, and then to also not have anything 
		distracting in the background at the same time. Also, to keep what is being said short and sweet, because its common that the audience will 
		not be very interested in something that just rambles on about almost nothing important. Keeping the strategies the commercial used in mind 
		will help my group in making our remix project successful.

		In class, we also went over a powerpoint that discussed visual rhetoric. It went over some principles of design. These principles included 
		balance, grouping, consistency, alignment, and contrast. A good design is key in visual genres. It gives its audience a sense of order and 
		they can discover the key points that they will be informed of. There needs to be balance in the section of the visual that is being looked 
		at. Is the audiences eyes attracted to one section more than the other. This is this case when there are pictures and text in the same frame. 
		People's eyes will often shift toward a picture, since it takes less effort and there are colors in it which is often attractive for 
		audiences eyes. Another important step is to have consistency throughout the whole visual. If there is no order that is being followed, it 
		will look very unprofessional, and will lose its value of importance. The audience is important to consider when designing such a project, 
		will it be people who like looking at pictures such as a child or artist, or is it a very informative person who may possibly reading over 
		looking at pictures. Different commercials and advertising were shown to help get us a sense of what works and what doesn't. This powerpoint 
		and short clips were very helpful in starting and working on the remix project, since it informed me of what I needed to include and what 
		to definitely avoid.

		We were finally introduced to our last project in the class. That is the final retrospective project. The overall goal was to reread the 
		reports and projects that I had previously wrote throughout the class. The purpose of this was to teach me ways of reflection, action, and 
		participation in inquiries. I would go about this by engaging in reading for a reason, to be able to reflect on myself, to analyze 
		critically the decisions that I had previously made while making my project. By doing just that, I hopes that I would be able to later 
		improve my writing, by knowing what I did, why I did those things, and why the things I did was either successful or not. To do this I had 
		go over different revision strategies to see if what I wrote was actually effective in what I wanted it to do. By doing this project I was 
		able to reflect on the things that I learned throughout the semester, the different strategies and rhetoric that I am now able to 
		incorporate in my future writings. I had to go back and read the assignment sheets to see if I had actually done everything that was needed 
		to get my point across in each type of writing. I realize that I truly did focus on touching on each thing that was needed, and with the 
		help of the different activities I was successful in having effective rhetoric in each project.   
		</p>
		<h1>blog entry 14</h1>
		<p>
		The last two projects that I worked on, the multimedia remix project and the final retrospective, I was required to work in a group. 
		Working in a group can teach someone a lot about not just others but also themselves. Working in a group forces someone to open their eyes 
		to different point of views. These two projects were a lot more effective because we had to work in a group. The remix project was a great 
		project to work in a group. If we had to work on it by ourself, no new point of view would be introduced to a project, so it would have 
		just been a repeat of the written project, just put into a different form to be shown on. Personally my group remix project for sure opened 
		my eyes to different point of views, the project that we remixed went over a cultural analysis issue that I had originally never thought 
		twice about. I was very glad after the project was done, because I felt like our documentary would impact anyone that was to watch it and 
		their point of views. The final retrospective project was also very successful in working in groups. This is because everyone was able to 
		see what another classmate had learned that year, and it could remind them of something that they just skipped over and hadn't realized had 
		an impact on them personally. If we only went over our own previous projects we could have possibly missed some key things that was taught 
		in the class and could later impact ones writings in the future.

		<h1>blog entry 15</h1>	
		<p>
		And now heres a blog about my blog. By writing about each week at a time, I was able to separate the semester into segments. I can now go 
		back and see how I have developed as a writer. With all the strategies that I have learned from different activities, different readings, 
		and different projects, I have become a much stronger writer. With reflecting on my writings and what I have learned it will allow me to 
		remember the strategies later in my writing career. I will be able to back to WRA 110 freshman spring semester and recall the strategies 
		that I learned from each project. All the activities and projects I did, I do think I have evolved as a writer. I do believe if we had 
		spent more time and really evaluated different strategies I could be even stronger, but I was still able to develop by reading the chapters 
		in my textbook to analyze different strategies that was effective in improving my writings. These 15 blog entries, was just effective in 
		developing writing strategies than any other project was. It allowed me to reflect and analyze how I learned more and more each week, which 
		is very effective in relearning the strategies that I was introduced to along the way. Everything that I participated in this class has had 
		an impact on my writing skills, I have learned, analyzed and reflected on different rhetoric that I will be able to use in my future 
		writings.
