		<h1>blog entry 1</h1>
		<p>The video was of Randy Potts telling a story using a letter to his deceased uncle, Ronnie, who 
		committed suicide in 1982 after years of struggling with his own sexuality. The purpose of the video was
		to explain that things get better. He wanted to share the story of the over comings of his own struggle to get 
		through his hard time. He wanted to spread the message to others the fact that life will go on, that it will all be
		worth fighting for. For Randy he had no example to follow. All he had was someone who gave up hope, who ran from
		himself and everyone else. Randy wanted to give a positive example to ones that are struggling just like he did, so he 
		shared the video to all who wanted to watch.  </p>
		<p>The video attempts to achieve its purpose by using extreme pathos. He uses a lot of emotion into telling the story.
		The way he words the story, with the emotion in his voice, and along with the emotion on his face, people can feel for him
		on an emotional level. They can see the pain that he has gone through. People began to feel connected to him whether or not
		they have gone through anything similar to him. Reading through the comments on the video it is obvious that it has done 
		just this. </p>
		<p>The structure of the message was as if he was writing a journal entry. He had not planned on sharing his story to just anyone.
		He started the whole video message by sharing a poem, so open the eyes of everyone who could be viewing, he wanted to interest
		all audiences. He opened himself up and told a true story. We received vivid imagery of all things that he went through. 
		He wrote it in sequence of the things that happened with adding personal feelings and emotions in it.</p>
		<p>This video's structure can help me revise my Lived Experiences project by adding more emotion in to it. I will need to
		change it to be less direct. Rather I need to act as if I am just writing a story that may not ever be shared to a superior.
		I need to have a less concrete connection and rather just have it flow to become interesting to almost anyone. The part in which
		I share my personal story needs to have emotion, other wise it is just plain and dull. </p>
		<h1>blog entry 2</h1>
		<p>The group of people targeted in the video are ones who stand up for what is right, for the good of the people in the
		world. This is commonly known as an advocate. Someone who steps out of their comfort zone to do the right thing.</p>
		<p>The social issue that this video tries to portray is doing what is right in the world. That if you know that someone
		is doing something wrong, the right thing would to do is to take a stand against it and do something about it to make it right.
		If you take a stand on something you have the power to make it that way. It might take time and failures to get there, but in the end 
		its the right thing to do, there should be nothing to stop you from doing it. These people who become advocated typically 
		influence other people to follow in their footsteps to make a difference in the world as well.</p>
		<p>The video's creator did a good job on showing this social issue based upon the way the show is. Although this type 
		of video is not my preference, they do get the point across. They showed people giving up which is very typical for someone
		going against odds, but through perseverance and the help of others, the right thing can and will be done.  </p>
