			<h1>Background Information</h1>
			<p>Medicine is known as the field of applied science related to the "art" of curing by diagnosis, treatment, and 
			prevention of disease and illness. It incorporates a variety of health care practices whose goal is to maintain and 
			restore health by the prevention and treatment of illness for their patients. The education for this disciple varies 
			around the world. Normally it involves an undergraduate degree, graduate degree at a medical school, internship, and 
			residency, before one can actually practice in the field. With medicine always advancing and evolving, it is required 
			to keep up to date in education in the field, which can include classes, medical journals, seminars, conferences, and 
			programs online.
			
			Medicine is not an exact science in the way that mathematics and physics are. It does have many general principles that 
			are valid most of the time, but not every patient, diagnosis or treatment is ever the same. With that being said 
			medicine is mostly experimental which takes research to a whole other level. The most accepted diagnosis and treatments 
			still need to be monitored, because its never certain that it will work perfectly for the patient, and that is where 
			research comes into play majorly in the medical field. There is constant research being done for medicine, new 
			treatments, new diagnosis, new pharmaceuticals, new surgery, all need to be researched ahead of time before ever 
			taking place. There are so many unanswered questions concerning the medical field, there will always be research 
			taking place because there will never be a time where all the questions are answered. It is an evolving and 
			experimental field that it is crucial to have research in the discipline.
			
			Medicine today is just as much about communication as it is science. The only thing that connects all aspects of the 
			medical field is communication, without it medicine could never evolve into what it is today and what it will be in 
			the future. Not only is communication important from doctor to patient, but behind the scenes it is very vital to have 
			strong communication among doctors. They doctors and health care providers have to communicate their research. This is 
			often done in journals and seminars. This sharing of research is vital for the field, just as much as communication 
			among doctor and patient is, because without the sharing of knowledge between professionals, patients will never get 
			the information that they need shared with them. </p>
