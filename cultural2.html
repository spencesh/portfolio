			<h1>Introduction</h1>
			<p>Discrimination comes in all shapes and sizes, as its definition: "treatment or consideration of, or making a 
			distinction in favor of or against, a person or thing based on the group, class, or category to which that person 
			or thing belongs rather than on individual merit"("Discrimination"). This affects everyone in todays world, whether 
			they are apparent of it or not. It takes place everywhere, on the internet, in the media, amongst people in different 
			settings. It's not always an issue that is brought to mind, often it is ignored since it is almost a way of life, but 
			it definitely takes place. The majority of people would say they aren't discriminate towards people because they don't 
			even realize what they are doing, it has become something that is only accepted by the subconscious. Major discrimination 
			issues come in waves, racial discrimination was a big deal in the 1950's, it has now blown over for the most part, 
			besides the areas that are accepted subconsciously, and currently in this era the biggest discrimination issue is a 
			form of sex discrimination; the social issue of same-sex marriage.</p>
