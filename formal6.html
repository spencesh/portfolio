			<h1>Research Section</h1>
			<p>The importance of medical research is immense. Professionals in the medical field have to keep up to date in their 
			research, and this is done through different programs, medical journals, and interaction with knowledgeable colleagues. 
			Even if personally the physician does not participate in research it is important that they can interpret the results 
			and apply it to their practice. There is a huge difference in the way information is  communicated among researcher to 
			researcher and how it is transferred from researcher to patient. Looking at researcher to researcher communication, in 
			order for one's findings of any research to be accepted as fact, to become an accepted and practiced part of scientific 
			knowledge, it must first be discussed and reviewed by other researchers. This process is very formal. Scientists have 
			to summarize their research in scientific papers and these papers are then published in professional journals. This is 
			how almost all scientific knowledge is created. Which explains how it is constantly changing, since new research 
			rapidly replaces the old, "medical research, like law, is constantly changing. Current information is crucial to the 
			medical researcher. Periodical literature, therefore, is of great importance and in this area, indexes of journals 
			reign supreme" (Leiter) stated from a trade publication. Researcher to patient communication is more of a chain 
			reaction. The researcher information first has to be accepted as fact as said earlier, then as doctors study to 
			further their knowledge they come across the new information from journals. They put these new facts into their 
			practice after many trials and experiments. Then these further knowledged doctors can share verbally to their patients 
			any new diagnosis or treatments that may impact them. These are two very different ways of communicating research, but 
			in all of the steps, literacies are the backbone for it to be a successful process. 
			
			I conducted an interview with my teacher assistant for chemistry who does research in the science field. 
			She discussed that research topics in chemistry covers a broad range: from highly theoretical to practical.  
			She explained that while some research seems to inform only chemistry theory, many research groups work on topics with 
			current industrial application in areas such as agriculture, pharmaceuticals, and energy technology,  "Research on 
			chemistry education works to further our understanding of how students learn and reason about chemistry topics so that 
			we may improve the ways in which we teach" (Kohn). She went over the facts that research findings are communicated 
			formally through peer-reviewed journals, seminars, and conferences. Also, on a daily basis and among members of a 
			research group, communication will occur through email and discussion. I asked how technology has impacted research 
			today, she responded with, "the internet has improved our ability to communicate with other scientists by placing 
			years of journal publications at our fingertips.  Journal and discipline-specific search engines allow us to sift 
			through the vast amount of available knowledge based on criteria such as the authors name or a specific chemical 
			structure" (Kohn). </p>
